# Twitch Streamer

This app is an experiment with using Vanilla-JS and Promise-based XMLHTTPRequests to fetch -- via JSONP -- data from the Twitch Streams API and expose it through a paging interface. 

The main portion of the code can be found in js/main.js -- which itself aims to thuroughly document how everythning works!
